# XIVPlanner

## API List
- https://xivapi.com/ - This will be used to search up the gear the user wants to save. Also comes with a lot more data that comes from the gameâ€™s data.

- https://www.fflogs.com/api/docs/ - This is a third party website that essentially parses the logs from the game and ranks the damage you did in raid. It has combat analysis and statistics over a large range of raids and ranks the damage you do. I will use this to get the data for a specific character and how well they did in a raid.

###Instructions
- Run the seed.py before running the app.
